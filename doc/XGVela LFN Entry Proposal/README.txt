Hello XGVela’s,

A draft of “XGVela LFN Entry Proposal” has been placed on GitHub: https://github.com/XGVela/XGVela/tree/master/doc/XGVela%20LFN%20Entry%20Proposal.
This document is required by the LFN Technical Advisory Council (TAC) for any project to be considered for inclusion under the LFN umbrella.

Community input into the document is required. Since we are using GitHub version control is mostly manual, as such, here are the ground rules for contributing to the document:

1.	Download a local version of the DRAFT document from the folder above.
2.	Change the filename of your local file to include your name and date.
3.	Update/contribute content to your local file.
4.	When ready use “Add file” in the folder above to add your renamed file to the folder.
5.	Do not delete any files from the folder.
6.	I will incorporate input/contributions into a master document and maintain version control.

Lets discuss on our Friday call.

This email has been turned into a README and placed in the document folder for reference.

Best,
-Louis
